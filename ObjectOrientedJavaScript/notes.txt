//in JS most things are objects
var names = ['ryu', 'crystal', 'mario'];
//sorting names
names.sort();
//by typing window in developers console we get access to all JS methods

//numbers, booleans and strings they are not objects, they are primitivetypes
//https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8511281/check-if-a-value-is-an-object-in-javascript
//eg var name is a primitive
var name = 'mario';
//when we call methods to the primitive it become an object, JS add aditional properties to it, so even non objects can behave like objects
name.length;
//below is an example of non-primitive string (an object)
var name2 = new String('ryu');
